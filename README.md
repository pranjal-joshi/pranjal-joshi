## Namaste 🙏, I'm [Pranjal](https://github.com/pranjal-joshi)

I am a self-taught developer and a DIY maker! I started my journey of programming when I was 17. As a student of electronics, I started making my own DIY projects using open-source hardware/software. Eventully, My interest shifted from writting firmware for the chips to the software development. I am a tech-enthusiastic, thus I divirsified my skills by learning Firmware development in C and C++, Hacking IoT with Linux, Full-stack web development, Cross platform App development using Dart, ML and Image Processing in Python!
Feel free to browse my repos, because you may find something really interesting! 👍
